Fullstack project using T-SQL, ADO.NET, ASP.NET and Angular (Typescript) with authentication, authorization and protected routes.

Welcome to the Musium project, an online jukebox with user accounts and CRUD for admins.

I made this project at the end of the 6+ months training I followed at Technofutur TIC in Belgium.

A live version is not available as hosting a C# .NET6 API is quite expensive. However, I recorded a live demo of the project in its current state: https://youtu.be/sl71nO8DCQg
